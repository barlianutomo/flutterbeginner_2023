          "1. Prepare the pot and fill it with planting media. To plant chilies, Moms can choose a pot with holes. This type of pot has a good drainage system so that water can come out of the pot and not make the plant rot. Fill the pot with planting medium leaving 5-10 cm from the rim of the pot. 2. Spread the chili seeds Moms can directly spread the chili seeds that you can buy at the agricultural shop at a distance of 5-10 cm. After that, cover with planting medium. Moms can also make your own chili seeds from chili seeds. To do this, Moms can take chili seeds from chilies that are ripe and red. Soak the chilies in a mixture of warm water and crushed shallots. Leave it overnight. The next day, take out the sunken chili seeds and dry them. The chili seeds have now become chili seeds ready for planting. 3. Flush with clean water. Water the planted chili seeds with clean water using a plant spray. Water twice a day in the morning and evening to keep the seeds moist.",
